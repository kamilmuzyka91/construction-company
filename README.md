## This App uses:

# Speed up the website

## Before

There are 25 photos on the website weighing 4.3 MB.
This slowed down the gallery loading time to 7.21s.
As a result, it is 71 points in Page Speed ​​Insights.

## After

After optimization, the page loads in 2.5s in the mobile version (94 point Page Speed ​​Insights) and 0.7s in the desktop version (99 point Page Speed ​​Insights). Now 25 photos weigh 2MB. I chose to use the webp format and 93% of web browsers now support it.

This is a 65% gain in the loading time of the mobile version to the initial state. I plan to improve this result.
